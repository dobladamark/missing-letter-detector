# missing-letter-detector

Finds the first missing consecutive character in a sequence of lowercase letters using their ASCII codes.

str.charCodeAt(i) → returns the numeric Unicode value of a character.

ASCII comparison:

Letters in the alphabet are in sequence (a = 97, b = 98, ...).

A gap greater than 1 means a letter is skipped.

String.fromCharCode() → converts ASCII back to a readable character.
